				<h1>Start reaping the actual benefits of AI. Not tomorrow, but today.</h1>
				<p> Have you been wondering about how you can apply AI in your organisation? 
					With our AI Design Sprint, we can help you discover how machine learning 
					will change and automate your business processes, and how your employees 
					could work with it, in just two weeks.

			<h2>AI Design Sprint</h2>
			<legend>/eɪ-aɪ dɪˈzaɪn sprɪnt/</legend>
			<p>An AI Design Sprint is a time-constrained process executed by an interdisciplinary 
				team. The process focuses on proving the practical applicability of artificial 
				intelligence models within an organisation. The result is a prototype that automates 
				parts of a business process, including a reflection on how a business will be able to 
				work with AI in the future.

			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<p>What are the steps of the AI Design Sprint?</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<img src="Assets/Illustraties/lifely-concept-transparant-2000x2000.png" alt="">
					<h3>Step 1: We research your process</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">Context is key.</p>
					<p class="description">We bring together your team to get your current process 
						on paper. When we know the goals and output of your process we can effectively 
						validate if we have successfully supported or replaced parts with AI solutions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>

					<h3>Step 2: We give you the knowledge to become future-proof </h3>
					<p class="subtitle">Setting the stage.</p>
					<p class="description">We invite experts to educate your team on what AI is, 
						what its use cases are, how it will develop in the future, and how it will 
						affect your industry and business.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>

					<h3>Step 3: We zoom in on what's important</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">Getting to the core.</p>
					<p class="description">To make sure we have a solid prototype, we have to create 
						focus. With your team, we decide which parts of your process will have the 
						biggest impact on efficiency and on cost savings.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="Assets/Illustraties/lifely-legacy-transparant-2000x2000.png" alt="">
					<h3>Step 4: We create a prototype</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">Augmenting your process.</p>
					<p class="description">Good preparation results in good execution. With the insights 
						of all the previous steps, we leverage AI models and create a prototype that 
						automates or enhances parts of your business processes.
					</p>
				</li>

					<h3>Step 5: And we make sure it works </h3>
					<p class="subtitle">Solve for good.</p>
					<p class="description">We bring back your team to test the prototype and see if 
						it's helpful and practical in real-world scenarios. In the end, you'll receive 
						the actual prototype (be it an API or script), and advice on whether or not your 
						organisation is ready to embrace AI.
